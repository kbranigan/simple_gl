Immediate mode OpenGL on a mac, probably without xcode, just with a simple Makefile - who thinks this is useful?

Apple doesn't want you to use OpenGL and and immediate mode is deprecated so much it could be 10 years deprecated.
But it's so much easier to prototype pure junk in immediate mode so why are we so afraid of it - also all that documentation on the internet!

Have fun, or don't whatever.  I also have working shader examples if that's your jank.

`make && ./cocoa_gl`
